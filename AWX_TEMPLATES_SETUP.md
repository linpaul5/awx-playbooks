## üéÆ Advanced Usage Examples

### Bulk Rule Creation
Run "Deploy Security Rule" multiple times with different variables:

```yaml
# Rule 1: Email Access
rule_action: "create"
rule_name: "Allow-Email-Services"
source_addresses: ["192.168.1.0/24"]
destination_addresses: ["mail.company.com"]
services: ["tcp-25", "tcp-993", "tcp-443"]
action_type: "allow"
```

```yaml
# Rule 2: Database Access
rule_action: "create"
rule_name: "Allow-Database-Access"
source_addresses: ["192.168.2.0/24"] 
destination_addresses: ["db.company.com"]
services: ["tcp-3306", "tcp-5432"]
action_type: "allow"
```

### Emergency Blocking
```yaml
rule_action: "create"
rule_name: "Emergency-Block-Malicious-IP"
rule_description: "Block malicious IP - Incident Response"
source_addresses: ["1.2.3.4"]
destination_addresses: ["any"]
action_type: "deny"
```

---

## üîß Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:
1. **Template not found**: Ensure project sync completed
2. **Execution Environment error**: Verify awx-palo-ee:latest exists
3. **API authentication failed**: Check API key in playbook
4. **Rule creation failed**: Verify zone names and applications exist

### Debug Mode:
Add to Extra Variables:
```yaml
debug_mode: true
ansible_verbosity: 2
```
